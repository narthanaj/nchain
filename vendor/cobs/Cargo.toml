    This is an implementation of the Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS) algorithm.
    COBS is an algorithm for transforming a message into an encoding where a specific value
    (the "sentinel" value) is not used. This value can then be used to mark frame boundaries
    in a serial communication channel. '''
